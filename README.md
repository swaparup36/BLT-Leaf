## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)
- Cloudflare account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OWASP-BLT/BLT-Leaf.git
cd BLT-Leaf
```

2. Install Wrangler (if not already installed):
```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

3. Login to Cloudflare:
```bash
wrangler login
```

4. Create the D1 database:
```bash
wrangler d1 create pr_tracker
```

5. Create `.env` file and populate it with Database ID from previous step:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

6. Apply database migrations:
```bash
# For local development
wrangler d1 migrations apply pr_tracker --local

# For production (remote database)
wrangler d1 migrations apply pr_tracker --remote
```

### Development

Run the development server:
```bash
wrangler dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8787`

### Deployment

Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:
```bash
wrangler deploy
```

### Testing

The application includes comprehensive test suites for rate limiting, caching features, and data display verification.

**Data Display Tests** (verifies project setup and data structure):
```bash
npm test
# or
node test-data-display.js
```

This test suite verifies:
- ✅ HTML structure and data display elements
- ✅ Python API handlers and endpoints
- ✅ Database schema completeness
- ✅ Configuration files (wrangler.toml, package.json)
- ✅ API routing and CORS configuration

**Quick Local Test** (watch wrangler console for logs):
```bash
node test-simple.js
```

**Full Production Test** (requires deployment):
```bash
npm run deploy
node test-production.js https://your-worker.workers.dev
```

For detailed testing instructions and expected behavior, see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

**Note**: Local development (`wrangler dev`) may not preserve worker state between requests. For accurate rate limiting and caching tests, deploy to production.

### Continuous Integration

The project includes a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs on push and pull requests:

**Test Data Display Workflow** (`.github/workflows/test-data-display.yml`):
- Runs on every push to main and pull request
- Sets up Node.js and installs dependencies
- Runs linting and format checks
- Verifies all required source files and configurations exist
- Runs comprehensive data display tests (48+ automated checks)
- Validates HTML structure, API endpoints, and database schema
- Checks Python syntax for all source files
- **Starts live Wrangler dev server** and tests against running application
- **Tests all API endpoints** including refresh functionality
- **Validates refresh button** works correctly to update PR data
- Performs security audit of dependencies

The workflow ensures that:
- The project setup is correct and complete
- All data display components are properly configured
- API endpoints are defined and routed correctly
- Frontend can successfully fetch and display data
- Database schema includes all required fields
- **Refresh functionality works to update PR data from GitHub**
- Code meets quality and security standards

To run the same checks locally:
```bash
npm test
```

## Usage

### Basic Tracking
1. **Add a PR**: Enter a GitHub PR URL in the format `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/number`
   - Note: Only open PRs can be added. Merged or closed PRs will be rejected.
2. **View Details**: See PRs in a sortable table with:
   - Repository and PR number
   - Author
   - Review status
   - Mergeable state
   - Files changed count
   - Check status (passed/failed/skipped)
   - Open conversations count (unresolved review threads)
   - Last updated time
3. **Sort PRs**: Click any column header to sort by that column
   - Sorting works across all pages (server-side sorting)
   - Click again to toggle ascending/descending order
   - Sorting resets to page 1 for consistent results
4. **Filter by Repo**: Click on a repository in the sidebar to filter PRs
5. **Refresh Data**: Use the refresh button to update PR information from GitHub
   - Note: If a PR has been merged or closed since being added, it will be automatically removed from tracking.

### PR Readiness Analysis
6. **Check Readiness**: Click the "Check Readiness" button on any PR row to analyze:
   - **Overall Score**: 0-100 combining CI confidence (60%) and review health (40%)

## Database Schema

The application uses a single table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE prs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    pr_url TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    repo_owner TEXT NOT NULL,
    repo_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    pr_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
    title TEXT,
    state TEXT,
    is_merged INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    mergeable_state TEXT,
    files_changed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    author_login TEXT,
    author_avatar TEXT,
    checks_passed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    checks_failed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    checks_skipped INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    review_status TEXT,
    last_updated_at TEXT,
    created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Readiness Scoring Algorithm

### Overall Score Calculation
```
Base Score = (CI Confidence × 45%) + (Review Health × 55%)

Apply Multipliers:
- Draft PR: Score = 0
- Merge Conflicts: Score × 0.67
- Changes Requested: Score × 0.5

Final Score = max(0, Score - (3 × open_conversations_count))
```

### Conversation Score Impact (NEW)
- **Open Conversations**: Unresolved review threads/conversations
- **Score Deduction**: -3 points per unresolved conversation
- **Detection**: Uses GitHub GraphQL API to fetch `reviewThreads` with `isResolved` status
- **Minimum Score**: 0 (score cannot go negative)

### CI Confidence Score (0-100)
- **All passing**: 100 points
- **Any failing**: Heavily penalized (0 points if all fail)
- **Skipped checks**: Minor penalty (−20% per skipped)
- **Pass rate**: `(passed / total) × 100 - (failed / total) × 80 - (skipped / total) × 20`

### Review Health Score (0-100)
Based on review state and responsiveness:
- **APPROVED**: 95 points (reviews approved)
- **ACTIVE**: 70-85 points (good back-and-forth, responsive author)
- **AWAITING_REVIEWER**: 60-80 points (author responded, waiting on reviewers)
- **AWAITING_AUTHOR**: 35-55 points (needs author response)
- **STALLED**: 10-30 points (unaddressed feedback >3 days)
- **NO_ACTIVITY**: 50 points (no reviews yet)

### Feedback Loop Detection
The system tracks reviewer-author interaction cycles:
1. **Reviewer Action**: Review submission or comment
2. **Author Response**: Commit, reply, or code change
3. **Response Tracking**: Measures time between feedback and response
4. **Staleness Detection**: Flags feedback >3 days without response

### Automatic Blocker Detection
- ❌ Failing CI checks
- ❌ Merge conflicts (dirty mergeable state)
- ❌ PR closed or already merged
- ❌ Stale unaddressed feedback (>3 days)
- ❌ Awaiting author response to change requests

### Warnings
- ⚠️ Unresolved review conversations
- ⚠️ Large PR (>30 files)
- ⚠️ Skipped CI checks
- ⚠️ No review activity yet

### Smart Recommendations
Context-aware suggestions based on PR state:
- Fix specific failing checks
- Address reviewer comments
- Resolve merge conflicts
- Resolve open review conversations
- Ping reviewers for approval
- Split large PRs (>30 files)
- Re-run flaky checks

## GitHub API

The application uses the GitHub REST API to fetch PR information. No authentication is required for public repositories, but rate limits apply (60 requests per hour for unauthenticated requests).

For private repositories or higher rate limits, you can add a GitHub token to the worker environment variables.

## Webhook Integration

BLT-Leaf supports GitHub webhooks for automatic PR updates, eliminating the need for manual refreshes.

### What is the Webhook?

The webhook endpoint (`POST /api/github/webhook`) receives real-time notifications from GitHub when events occur on your tracked pull requests. This keeps your PR tracking data automatically synchronized with GitHub.

### Which Events Would You Like to Trigger This Webhook?

When setting up the webhook in your GitHub repository, select the following events:

**Recommended Events:**
- ✅ **Pull requests** - Automatically updates PR data when PRs are:
  - `closed` - Removes closed/merged PRs from tracking
  - `reopened` - Re-adds reopened PRs to tracking
  - `synchronize` - Updates PR when new commits are pushed
  - `edited` - Updates PR metadata (title, description, etc.)

**Optional Events** (for future enhancements):
- ⚪ **Pull request reviews** - Detects when reviews are submitted, edited, or dismissed
- ⚪ **Check runs** - Monitors CI/CD check completions
- ⚪ **Check suites** - Tracks overall check suite status

> **Note:** Currently, only the `pull_request` event is fully processed. Other events are acknowledged but do not trigger updates yet.

### Webhook Setup

1. **Configure the webhook secret** (required for production):
   ```bash
   # Generate a secure random secret
   openssl rand -hex 32
   
   # Add to your Cloudflare Worker secrets
   wrangler secret put GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   # You will be prompted to paste the secret generated above
   ```

2. **Add the webhook to your GitHub repository:**
   - Go to your repository settings → Webhooks → Add webhook
   - **Payload URL**: `https://your-worker.workers.dev/api/github/webhook`
   - **Content type**: `application/json`
   - **Secret**: Enter the same secret you configured in step 1
   - **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?**
     - Select "Let me select individual events"
     - Check: ✅ Pull requests
     - Optionally check: Pull request reviews, Check runs, Check suites
   - **Active**: ✅ Checked
   - Click "Add webhook"

3. **Verify the webhook is working:**
   - Make a change to a tracked PR (e.g., add a commit or close it)
   - Check the webhook delivery logs in GitHub to ensure it was successfully delivered
   - Verify that your PR tracker updates automatically

### Security

The webhook endpoint verifies GitHub's signature using HMAC SHA-256 to ensure requests are authentic. Always configure `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in production to prevent unauthorized access.

**Development Mode:** If `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is not set, signature verification is skipped (use only for local testing).
