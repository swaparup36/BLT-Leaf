## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)
- Cloudflare account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OWASP-BLT/BLT-Leaf.git
cd BLT-Leaf
```

2. Install Wrangler (if not already installed):
```bash
npm install -g wrangler
```

3. Login to Cloudflare:
```bash
wrangler login
```

4. Create the D1 database:
```bash
wrangler d1 create pr_tracker
```

5. Update `wrangler.toml` with your database ID from the previous step.

6. Initialize the database schema:
```bash
wrangler d1 execute pr_tracker --file=./schema.sql
```

### Development

Run the development server:
```bash
wrangler dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8787`

### Deployment

Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:
```bash
wrangler deploy
```

### Testing

The application includes comprehensive test suites for rate limiting and caching features.

**Quick Local Test** (watch wrangler console for logs):
```bash
node test-simple.js
```

**Full Production Test** (requires deployment):
```bash
npm run deploy
node test-production.js https://your-worker.workers.dev
```

For detailed testing instructions and expected behavior, see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

**Note**: Local development (`wrangler dev`) may not preserve worker state between requests. For accurate rate limiting and caching tests, deploy to production.

## Usage

### Basic Tracking
1. **Add a PR**: Enter a GitHub PR URL in the format `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/number`
   - Note: Only open PRs can be added. Merged or closed PRs will be rejected.
2. **View Details**: See PRs in a sortable table with:
   - Repository and PR number
   - Author
   - Review status
   - Mergeable state
   - Files changed count
   - Check status (passed/failed/skipped)
   - Last updated time
3. **Sort PRs**: Click any column header to sort by that column
4. **Filter by Repo**: Click on a repository in the sidebar to filter PRs
5. **Refresh Data**: Use the refresh button to update PR information from GitHub
   - Note: If a PR has been merged or closed since being added, it will be automatically removed from tracking.

### PR Readiness Analysis
6. **Check Readiness**: Click the "Check Readiness" button on any PR row to analyze:
   - **Overall Score**: 0-100 combining CI confidence (60%) and review health (40%)
   - **Score Breakdown**: See individual CI and review scores
   - **Blockers**: Critical issues preventing merge (failing checks, conflicts, stale feedback)
   - **Warnings**: Non-blocking concerns (awaiting approval, large PR size)
   - **Recommendations**: Specific actionable next steps
   - **Response Metrics**: Author responsiveness and feedback address rate

### Readiness Classifications

- 🔴 **NOT_READY** (<40): Major problems, not safe to merge

### Review Health States
- **APPROVED** (90-100): Reviews approved, ready to go
- **ACTIVE** (70-85): Good progress with responsive author
- **AWAITING_REVIEWER** (60-80): Author responded, waiting on reviewers
- **AWAITING_AUTHOR** (35-55): Author needs to address feedback
- **STALLED** (10-30): Unaddressed feedback >3 days old
- **NO_ACTIVITY** (50): No reviews or feedback yet

```sql
CREATE TABLE prs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    pr_url TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    repo_owner TEXT NOT NULL,
    repo_name TEXT NOT NULL,
    pr_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
    title TEXT,
    state TEXT,
    is_merged INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    mergeable_state TEXT,
    files_changed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    author_login TEXT,
    author_avatar TEXT,
    checks_passed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    checks_failed INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    checks_skipped INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    review_status TEXT,
    last_updated_at TEXT,
    created_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TEXT DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Readiness Scoring Algorithm

### Overall Score Calculation
```
Overall Score = (CI Confidence × 60%) + (Review Health × 40%)
```

### CI Confidence Score (0-100)
- **All passing**: 100 points
- **Any failing**: Heavily penalized (0 points if all fail)
- **Skipped checks**: Minor penalty (−20% per skipped)
- **Pass rate**: `(passed / total) × 100 - (failed / total) × 80 - (skipped / total) × 20`

### Review Health Score (0-100)
Based on review state and responsiveness:
- **APPROVED**: 95 points (reviews approved)
- **ACTIVE**: 70-85 points (good back-and-forth, responsive author)
- **AWAITING_REVIEWER**: 60-80 points (author responded, waiting on reviewers)
- **AWAITING_AUTHOR**: 35-55 points (needs author response)
- **STALLED**: 10-30 points (unaddressed feedback >3 days)
- **NO_ACTIVITY**: 50 points (no reviews yet)

### Feedback Loop Detection
The system tracks reviewer-author interaction cycles:
1. **Reviewer Action**: Review submission or comment
2. **Author Response**: Commit, reply, or code change
3. **Response Tracking**: Measures time between feedback and response
4. **Staleness Detection**: Flags feedback >3 days without response

### Automatic Blocker Detection
- ❌ Failing CI checks
- ❌ Merge conflicts (dirty mergeable state)
- ❌ PR closed or already merged
- ❌ Stale unaddressed feedback (>3 days)
- ❌ Awaiting author response to change requests

### Smart Recommendations
Context-aware suggestions based on PR state:
- Fix specific failing checks
- Address reviewer comments
- Resolve merge conflicts
- Ping reviewers for approval
- Split large PRs (>30 files)
- Re-run flaky checks

## GitHub API

The application uses the GitHub REST API to fetch PR information. No authentication is required for public repositories, but rate limits apply (60 requests per hour for unauthenticated requests).

For private repositories or higher rate limits, you can add a GitHub token to the worker environment variables.
